# You may apply one $5 or $10 cash off per order.
# The second is percent discount coupons for 10%, 15%, or 20% off.
# If you have cash-off coupons, those must be applied first, then apply the percent discount coupons on the pre-tax
#  Then you add tax at 6% and shipping according to these guidelines:
#
# up to $10 dollars, shipping is $5.95
# $10 and up to $30 dollars, shipping is $7.95
# $30 and up to $50 dollars, shipping is $11.95
# Shipping is free for $50 and over
